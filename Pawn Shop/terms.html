		â€ƒ
		Free website terms and conditions: drafting notes<br/>
		This is a free version of our standard website terms and conditions document. It is identical to that document, save that this version includes an SEQ legal credit.  In addition to the provisions that would typically be included in any set of website terms and conditions, this document includes provisions covering user accounts and user-generated content (although the latter are not as detailed as in some of our more sophisticated website terms and conditions documents).  If your website does not feature user accounts or interactive features, you may wish to consider our website disclaimer document instead of these terms and conditions.<br/>
		Section 1: Introduction<br/>
		Section 1.2<br/>
		Optional element.<br/>
		The completed document should be easily accessible on the website, with a link from every page.<br/>
		Section 1.3<br/>
		Optional element. Will all or any website users give their express consent to the terms of this document?<br/>
		Ideally, from a legal perspective, all users would be asked to expressly agree to the terms of the document. However, in practice, express consent is rarely sought from casual website visitors. On the other hand, it is easy to obtain the express consent of users who register with the website or submit any material to the website, e.g. by clicking "I accept" on an electronic version of the document. You should retain evidence of the acceptance of the document terms by each such user.<br/>
		â€¢	Under what circumstances will users be asked to give their express consent to the terms of this document?<br/>
		Section 1.4<br/>
		Optional element. Are there any age restrictions on the use of the website?
		The use of websites by minors can be legally problematic. There are a number of different legal issues. For example, under English law, contracts may be unenforceable against minors. Another issue concerns data protection. The law of data protection imposes additional burdens in relation to the processing of any personal data of a minor and personal data provided by a minor. The effects of the law of indecency may also depend upon whether a website is accessible by minors. Obviously, the inclusion of a requirement in your terms and conditions that minors refrain from using a website is no guarantee that they will do so. Where your website is directed at, or likely to be used by, minors, we recommend that you seek specialist legal advice.<br/>
		â€¢	What is the minimum age for website users?<br/>
		Section 1.5<br/>
		Optional element. Does the website use cookies (including session cookies and third party cookies)?<br/>
		The inclusion of this statement in your website legal documents will not in itself satisfy the requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (as amended) concerning consent to the use of cookies. Guidance concerning methods of obtaining such consent is included on the Information Commissioner's website (http://www.ico.gov.uk).<br/>
		â€¢	What is the title of the document on the website that contains cookie information?<br/>
		Section 2: Credit<br/>
		Optional element. Although you need to retain the SEQ Legal credit, you should remove the inline copyright warning from this document before use.<br/>
		Section 3: Copyright notice<br/>
		Section 3.1<br/>
		â€¢	What was the year of first publication of the relevant copyright material (or the range of years)?<br/>
		â€¢	Who is the principal owner of copyright in the website?<br/>
		Section 4: Licence to use website<br/>
		The scope of the licence to use will vary with each site. Consider carefully exactly what your users should be allowed to do with your website and material on your website.<br/>
		Section 4.1<br/>
		â€¢	Will audio and/or video files be published on the website?<br/>
		â€¢	Will the website make available any dynamic services to users?<br/>
		â€¢	Describe the website services in question.<br/>
		Section 4.2<br/>
		Optional element.<br/>

		Optional element.<br/>
		â€¢	For what purposes may the website be used?<br/>
		Section 4.4<br/>
		Optional element.<br/>

		Optional element. Are users permitted to redistribute any specific content from the website (e.g. newsletters)?<br/>
		â€¢	What types of content are redistributable?<br/>
		â€¢	In what formats may redistributable content be redistributed?<br/>
		â€¢	To whom may redistributable content be redistributed?<br/>
		Section 5: Acceptable use<br/>
		Section 5.1<br/>
		â€¢	Should automated interactions with the website be prohibited?<br/>
		â€¢	Will the website incorporate a robots.txt file?<br/>
		â€¢	Should users be prohibited from using the website for direct marketing activity?<br/>
		Section 5.2<br/>
		Optional element. Should the use of data collected from the website to contact people and businesses be prohibited?<br/>
		Section 5.3<br/>
		Optional element.<br/>
		â€¢	What standard of veracity etc should user-submitted content meet?
		Section 6: Registration and accounts<br/>
		Section 6.1<br/>
		Optional element. Do any eligibility criteria apply to account registration?<br/>
		â€¢	What eligibility criteria apply?<br/>
		Section 6.2<br/>
		â€¢	How do users register with the website?<br/>
		Section 6.3<br/>
		Optional element. Will users be permitted to share their accounts?<br/>
		Section 6.4<br/>
		Optional element.<br/>
		Section 6.5<br/>
		Optional element.<br/>
		â€¢	Are users permitted to use another person's account on the website with the permission of that other person?<br/>
		Section 7: User login details<br/>

		Optional element. Can users edit their own content after it has been posted to the website?<br/>
